# Welcome to  CIPHER DAIRIES :books:
***
A collection of Cipher implementations in different langauges.

## What is a cipher?
**In cryptography, a cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption—a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure.**

## Why this repository?
Learning cipher algorithms and getting started with open source contribution are the two main ojectives of this repository.

## Steps to get started and make your pull request...
1. **FORK THE REPO**
Forking the repository(repo) makes a copy of someone else's project as your own to start working on it.
 [![Fork Button](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg)](https://github.com/happycoder0011/CIPHER_DIARIES/tree/master)

2.**Clone**
To start coding and making changes in the repository, you need to have the project locally on your local machine.Use the command below to clone(download) the project.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/happycoder0011/CIPHER_DIARIES.git
```
**Note:** To clone in a particular folder, run the below command first then clone command.
```sh
cd folder_name
```
3.**Enter project folder**
```sh
cd CIPHER_DIARIES
```
4.**Set Up to contribute**
Run the below command to check wether your local copy has the reference to the forked remote repository on github.
```sh
git remote -v 
```

You should get an output similar to 
```sh
origin  https://github.com/Your_user_name/CIPHER_DIARIES.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Your_user_name/CIPHER_DIARIES.git (push)
```

If not!! Check that you are in the right folder of the project. Otherwise fork again and reiterate the steps.

Add a reference to the original CIPHER_DIARIES repo:
```sh
git remote add upstream  https://github.com/happycoder0011/CIPHER_DIARIES.git
```

Check if it's added 
```sh
git remote -v
```

You should get output as
```sh
origin  https://github.com/Your_user_name/CIPHER_DIARIES.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Your_user_name/CIPHER_DIARIES.git (push)
upstream   https://github.com/happycoder0011/CIPHER_DIARIES.git (fetch)
upstream   https://github.com/happycoder0011/CIPHER_DIARIES.git (fetch)
```

# Voila!!! Set up done.

Start by adding your files, codes and commit to your copy of the project.

Command to commit
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
git push origin master
```

**Note:** You would be working on your local project. Always make sure to pull the repo before pushing your code to see the changes made by other contributors.
```sh
git pull
```

After you have successfully pushed your code on your remote copy(github) of the project. You can compare the branch with the original repo on github and make a pull request!
